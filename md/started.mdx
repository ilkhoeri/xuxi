### **What Xuxi can do:**

– **Cleanly** concatenate strings.
– **Deeply** concatenate objects.
– Supports **multiple argument** types.
– **Removes falsy values**, empty objects in deep objects.
– **Chaining** capabilities.
– Can run in **various runtime** conditions.

### **How Can Xuxi Help You?**

With Xuxi, you no longer have to worry about redundant values in API responses, inefficient data structures, or overly complex condition-based styling. Xuxi takes care of these problems **automatically**, allowing you to focus on building great applications.

Xuxi is an **open-source, community-driven** utility. It is built with extensibility in mind, encouraging contributions and improvements. Whether you're a **backend engineer**, **frontend developer**, or **full-stack builder**, Xuxi can significantly streamline your workflow.

## **Why Use Xuxi?**

### **🚀 Versatile & Dynamic**

Xuxi is designed to work in multiple scenarios, including API data transformation, UI styling, and configuration management. Its dynamic chaining and flexible input handling make it a valuable tool for any development workflow.

### **🔄 Optimized & Efficient**

By automatically filtering out unwanted values and merging data intelligently, Xuxi reduces unnecessary computations and improves performance, ensuring that only meaningful values are retained.

### **🌐 Universal Compatibility**

- **Supports both frontend & backend development** – Xuxi can be used in any JavaScript or TypeScript environment, including Node.js, Next.js, React, and more.
- **Compatible with various module systems** – Xuxi supports **ESM (ECMAScript Modules)** and **CJS (CommonJS)**, making it easy to integrate into modern and legacy projects.
- **Optimized for modern JavaScript** – Compiled with `"lib": ["ES2020", "es5", "es6", "es7", "esnext", "dom"]` and targeting **ES2018**, ensuring broad compatibility without sacrificing modern optimizations.

### **🔧 Simple API, Powerful Features**

Xuxi offers a concise API that is easy to use while maintaining the flexibility to handle **deep object structures, nested arrays, and function-based value resolution**. Its intuitive design allows developers to manage data dynamically without unnecessary complexity.

## **Core Features**

1. **Dynamic API Response Handling**

   - Seamlessly combine API responses with nested objects, filtering out unnecessary values while preserving important data.
   - Ensures structured and meaningful API outputs.

2. **Flexible Data Serialization**

   - Handles deep object serialization, allowing for selective value retention and structured data merging.
   - Provides fine-grained control over how objects, arrays, and primitive values are combined.

3. **Effortless Style & Class Management**

   - Simplifies dynamic class name composition for UI frameworks (similar to `clsx` and `cva` but with a more intuitive syntax).
   - Supports conditional styles, function-based merging, and array/object-based class handling.

4. **Zero Overhead & High Performance**
   - Lightweight and optimized for performance.
   - Avoids redundant processing, ensuring minimal runtime impact.
