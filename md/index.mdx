# **Welcome to Xuxi**

**Xuxi** is a powerful and flexible utility designed to simplify dynamic data management. Whether you're working with **API responses**, **complex serialization**, **dynamic styles**, or **structured data merging**, Xuxi provides an efficient and elegant solution.

Built with performance and scalability in mind, Xuxi supports **ESM**, **CJS**, and **modern JavaScript environments**, making it highly versatile for both **frontend and backend** applications.

---

## **Why Xuxi?**

Modern applications require a highly flexible and efficient way to handle structured data dynamically. Xuxi is designed to address these challenges with:

- **Efficient API Response Handling** - Combine, clean, and structure API responses seamlessly.
- **Advanced Data Serialization** - Process deeply nested objects without complexity.
- **Dynamic String Management** - Merge conditional string with ease and more powerful.
- **Smart Object Merging** - Preserve important values while ensuring flexibility in updates.
- **Optimized Performance** - Built-in cycle detection prevents infinite loops, and optimized processing ensures minimal overhead.
- **Seamless TypeScript Support** - Fully typed for enhanced developer experience.

## **Core Features**

### **ocx - Object Combination with Chaining**

Xuxi provides a powerful object merging utility with a **chaining mechanism** for advanced configurations.

```ts
function ocx<T extends ocxKey>(...obj: ocxObj<T>[]): ocxAcc<T>;
```

### **clean - Deep Cleaning of Objects**

Removes falsy values, empty objects, and unnecessary data while maintaining control over exclusions.

```ts
function clean<T extends ocxKey>(obj: T, exclude?: unknown[]): T;
```

### **cnx - Dynamic String Management**

A simplified and powerful alternative to `clsx` that supports all argument types, including functions.

```ts
function cnx(...inputs: cnxValues[]): string;
```

### **cvx - Variance Handling Management**

A flexible variant handling utility similar to `cva`, but with a more intuitive syntax.

```ts
function cvx<T extends cvxKeys>(keys: cvxRecord<T>): (result?: cvxResult<T>) => string;
```
